# Myles

Myles: An elegant and a grand framework for developing cloud applications and services.
	Think of it as the basic and essential part of most cloud apps and services.
	And more codes can be added to it, to produce your desired app (or service).

Due to limited manpower, Myles currently has no usage document, but would have in the
	nearest future.
