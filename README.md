# Amanda

Amanda is a framework for developing cloud applications, and it is HTTPS-based. This framework takes a form quite different from many other frameworks. Rather than existing as a package that is imported, the framework is a software on its own. It can be turned into a custom cloud application, by adding your app services and other capabilities the app needs.

### Pros

 - Built-in logger (which can be replaced)
 - HTTP and HTTPS
 - Configuration file support
 - Highly extensible
 - Support for admin services
 - Simple and easy
 - Lightweight 

### Cons

 - IPv6 currently not fully supported
