# Myles

Myles: An elegant and a grand framework for developing cloud applications and services. It's
	clean, elegant, intuitive, developed correctly, highy and easily extendable,
	modifiable, and so on. Think of it as the basic and essential part of most cloud
	apps and services. And more codes can be added to it, to produce your desired app or
	service.

Due to limited manpower, Myles currently has no usage document, but would have in the
	nearest future.
